Face Detection and Recognition using Haar Cascade Classifiers, CV2, KNN
# How to use
1. Run face detection notebook first and generate facial data, code needs to be run multiple times to add new people
2. Note : run face detection in a preferably well lit environment for good accuracy
3. Run face recognition once data has been generated
